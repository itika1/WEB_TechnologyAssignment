    <p>Information Technology is a branch of study that has emerged over a little more than the last two decades. While the term “Computer Science” is usually reserved for the more theoretical, academic aspects of computing, the term “Information Technology” encompasses more of the applications dealing with real-life human activities and non – computerized business processes like knowledge management.

        Keeping precisely the above important aspects of computer science and communication technology tied together in the curriculum, the department of Information Technology was introduced in 1999, at the same time of the inception of MCKVIE. Enriched with highly qualified Faculty members and equipped with state-of-the-art computer labs the Department has been producing highly trained and competent software engineers who have already proved their quality and worth in the job market, education and even in research work.</p>
